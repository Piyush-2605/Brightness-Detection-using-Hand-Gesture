# Brightness Detection and Control Using Hand Gestures  

This project demonstrates real-time brightness control of a video feed using hand gestures, implemented with **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**.  

Features  
- Detects hand landmarks using **MediaPipe Hands**.  
- Measures the distance between the thumb and index finger to adjust the brightness of the video feed dynamically.  
- Real-time drawing of hand landmarks on the video feed.  

Prerequisites  
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
